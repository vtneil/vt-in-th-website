## Guide (Please read!!!)

There are 3 levels of difficulty of practice problems which will help 
guide you on how you do the assignment.

1. Concept (★☆☆) will help you recheck yourself whether you understood the content.
2. Apply (★★☆) will step up some difficulty where you have to apply several concepts.
3. Technique (★★★) is more challenging.

The problems will state inputs and outputs of the program.
Inputs and outputs can be more than one, one each, see examples for more details.
